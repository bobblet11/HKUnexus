## Discover Your Community with Our New App!

At HKU, students are eager to find vibrant communities to share their interests and explore new activities through hobby clubs, such as sports and arts. While joining an official HKU society is a great option, many niche interests often remain uncovered. This leads students to create their own groups, relying on various social platforms for promotion. Unfortunately, this approach can be frustrating—spamming feeds and hoping for attention rarely leads to success.
